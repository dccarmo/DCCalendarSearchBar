###DCCalendarSearchBar
===================

####About

A simple iOS Calendar App like UISeachDisplayController implementation.

I needed one for a project I'm working on and decided to share so others could check it out as well.

This implementation relies on iOS 7.0 UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate, so it's only for iOS 7.0+ use only.

####Usage

Simply import it in your project and use the designated initializer: "initWithDataSourceViewController:". When you need the search, present the view controller.
The UISearchBar is exposed for appearance customization. 
Check out the demo for further assistance.
